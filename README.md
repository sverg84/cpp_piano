# sverg cpp_piano

## Overview

This is my first time coding in C++ in about 5 years. In this small solo project, the user will be able to play a virtual piano using their computer's keyboard.

This project assumes the user has a *macOS* device. This was developed with a MacBook and is, consequently, not built with Windows compatibility.

The piano backend and its "user interface" were all written exclusively in C++, compiled with the GNU++17 ISO/IEC 14882 standard for C++ and incorporating the [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) for rendering the graphics and interpreting the audio.

## How to Play

The white piano keys are represented by the center row of the QWERTY keyboard between *Caps Lock* and *Enter/Return*â€”the white keys are *A* through *Quote (')*. The black piano keys are in the row above, consistent with the visualization of the keys as rendered in the piano UI. For reference, the QWERTY keyboard keys for the black piano keys are: *W*, *E*, *T*, *Y*, *U*, *O*, and *P*.
